#Age and Gender Detection using Deep Learning
Description
This project uses a deep learning model to detect age and gender from facial images. The model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and is integrated into a user-friendly GUI created using Tkinter and OpenCV. The application allows users to upload an image, recognize the face in the image, and predict the age and gender of the person.

#Features
Face Detection: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting faces in an image.
Age Prediction: Predicts the age of the detected person.
Gender Prediction: Classifies the gender of the person as either Male or Female.
GUI Interface: Simple Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.
Installation
Follow the steps below to set up the project and run the Age & Gender Detection application.

#Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
OpenCV
PIL (Pillow)
NumPy
Tkinter
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You can install the required libraries using pip:

#bash

pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy
Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-gender-detection.git
Step 3: Download Pre-trained Model
Download the pre-trained Age_Sex_Detection.keras model file from the link provided in the project or use your own trained model.

Place the downloaded model in the root directory of the project.

Step 4: Run the Application
Navigate to the project folder and run the Python script to launch the GUI:

#bash

python gui.py
Step 5: Upload an Image
Once the GUI opens, click the Upload an Image button to select an image file. The application will automatically detect the face, predict the age, and classify the gender.

#Usage
Upload an Image: Click on the "Upload an Image" button and select a photo containing a face.
Face Detection: The application will detect faces using OpenCV.
Age & Gender Prediction: After detecting the face, the model will predict the age and gender of the person.
Results: The predicted age and gender will be displayed below the uploaded image.
